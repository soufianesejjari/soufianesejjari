### Hi there I'am Soufiane Sejjari - Data Scientist and Software Developer student   üëã


## Overview üî≠
Welcome to my profile! I'm a dedicated data scientist and software developer currently pursuing my Master's degree. With a strong passion for leveraging technology to solve problems and drive innovation, I've undertaken diverse projects spanning data analysis, web development, and mobile app development.

##  Skills and Technologies üõ†Ô∏è
- Data analysis: Python, SQL, machine learning algorithms, data visualization tools (e.g. Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
- Data science: data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection and evaluation, natural language processing
- Web development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL
- Mobile development: Kotlin, Android API
- Other: Git, GitHub, Linux, agile development methodologies
## Projects üõ†Ô∏è
- [**Appointment Management System**](https://github.com/soufianesejjari/GesRDV): Developed using Spring Boot, Spring Security, and Spring Data JPA for the backend, and React Native with Redux for the frontend mobile application. This system enables users to schedule medical appointments, featuring user authentication, real-time availability checks, and appointment confirmation.
- [**COVID-19 Awareness and Statistics Android App**](https://github.com/soufianesejjari/COVID-19-Awareness-and-Statistics-Mobile-App-Real-time-Information-and-Infection-Risk-Prediction) : an Android mobile app that provides real-time statistics and information about COVID-19 in Morocco, as well as a machine learning model that predicts the risk of infection. Developed using Kotlin, Android API, and machine learning algorithms in Python and Scala.
- [ **Data Visualization with Power BI and ETL with Talend** ](https://github.com/soufianesejjari/Visualizing-MySQL-OLAP-Database-with-PowerBI-A-Case-of-ETL-driven-Data-Exploration): A data visualization dashboard using Power BI and the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from an OLTP MySQL database to an OLAP MySQL data warehouse using Talend.
- [ **Data Visualization and Processing Web Application** ](https://github.com/soufianesejjari/Streamlining-Data-Collection-and-Analysis-Google-Forms-API-and-Python): A web application that allows users to visualize and analyze data collected from a Google Form questionnaire, using Python, SPSS, Talend, Streamlit, and an API
- [ **ScalaProjet JavaFX/Scala POS System** ](https://github.com/soufianesejjari/JavaFX-Scala-POS-System-with-dashboard): a JavaFX/Scala based Point of Sale system that allows users to view and manage sales data in an **interactive dashboard** . The application uses a MySQL database to store and retrieve data.
- [ **API de visites (Visits API)** ](https://github.com/soufianesejjari/Api_python_for_visualisaion): A service that retrieves data from a MySQL database and performs data processing to generate dynamic graphs. The API also incorporates caching mechanisms for performance optimization and reduced database queries.
- [ **Data Analysis on LinkedIn Profiles of ENSIAS Students** ](https://github.com/soufianesejjari/Data-scraping-and-Analysis-LinkedIn-Profiles-Students): In this project, I conducted data analysis on LinkedIn profiles of ENSIAS students. By utilizing web scraping, JSON, Python, and MongoDB, I uncovered trends in skills and experiences to enhance education and career opportunities for students.
